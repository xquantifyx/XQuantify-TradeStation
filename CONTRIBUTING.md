## üìù Coding Standards

### Shell Scripts

- Use `#!/bin/bash` shebang
- Set `set -e` for error handling
- Use meaningful variable names (UPPERCASE for environment variables)
- Add comments for complex logic
- Use functions for reusable code
- Include error messages with `print_error` function

**Example:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

# Function to check Docker
check_docker() {
    if ! command -v docker &> /dev/null; then
        print_error "Docker not found"
        return 1
    fi
    print_success "Docker found"
}
```

### Dockerfile

- Group related RUN commands to reduce layers
- Use `--no-install-recommends` for apt-get
- Clean up package manager caches
- Use specific versions when possible
- Add comments explaining non-obvious steps

### Docker Compose

- Use version 3.8 or higher
- Include labels for all services
- Set restart policies appropriately
- Use health checks
- Document environment variables

### Documentation

- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples
- Add screenshots when helpful
- Keep formatting consistent
- Update table of contents if applicable
