## Custom Broker Installation

If your broker is not pre-configured, you can add it manually.

### Finding Your Broker's MT5 Installer

Most brokers provide MT5 installers on their website:

1. Visit your broker's website
2. Look for "Platforms" or "Download MT5" section
3. Right-click on "Download MT5" â†’ "Copy link address"
4. Use this URL in the configuration

**Common URL patterns:**
- `https://download.mql5.com/cdn/web/[broker-name]/mt5/[broker]5setup.exe`
- `https://download.[broker].com/mt5setup.exe`
- `https://www.[broker].com/platforms/mt5/installer.exe`

### Method 1: Using Install Script
```bash
./install.sh
# Select option 12) Custom
# Paste your broker's installer URL
```

### Method 2: Using Make Command
```bash
make build-custom URL=https://your-broker.com/mt5setup.exe
make start
```

### Method 3: Using Environment Variables
Edit `.env`:
```bash
BROKER=custom
MT5_INSTALLER_URL=https://your-broker.com/mt5setup.exe
```

Then build:
```bash
make build
make start
```

      "description": "Description of your broker",
      "auto_login_support": true
    }
  }
}

## Common Issues

### Installer Download Fails

**Problem:** Wget fails to download MT5 installer

**Solutions:**
1. Verify URL is direct download link
2. Check if URL requires authentication
3. Try downloading manually first:
   ```bash
   wget -O test.exe "YOUR_URL"
   ```
4. Use curl instead:
   ```dockerfile
   # In Dockerfile, replace wget with:
   curl -L -o /home/mt5user/mt5/mt5setup.exe "URL"
   ```

### Wrong MT5 Version Installed

**Problem:** Broker's MT5 looks different than expected

**Cause:** Some brokers customize MT5 heavily

**Solution:** This is normal. Each broker's MT5 may have:
- Different branding
- Custom indicators pre-installed
- Broker-specific features

### Can't Login After Install

**Problem:** MT5 starts but can't login

**Possible Causes:**
1. Wrong server name (check your broker's documentation)
2. Wrong account credentials
3. Server requires specific MT5 version
4. Account not activated yet

**Solutions:**
- Verify `MT5_SERVER` value in `.env`
- Check account number and password
- Contact broker support for correct server name

### Multiple Accounts from Same Broker

**Setup multiple instances:**

```bash
# Instance 1
make scale N=2

# Configure each instance differently
# Edit docker-compose.yml to pass different credentials
```

## Verification

### Test Broker Installation

After building with your broker:

```bash
# Start services
make start

# Check logs for successful MT5 installation

# Access MT5
# Open http://localhost

# Check MT5 shows correct broker name in title
```

### Successful Installation Signs

## Getting Help

### Broker Not Working

1. Check broker's official MT5 download page
2. Verify installer URL is accessible:
   ```bash
   curl -I "YOUR_INSTALLER_URL"
   ```
3. Try building with official MetaQuotes first:
   ```bash
   make build
   ```
4. Contact broker support for MT5 installer link

### Request Broker Addition

If you'd like a broker added to pre-configured list:

1. Open GitHub issue
2. Provide:
   - Broker name
   - Official MT5 installer URL
   - Any special configuration notes

## Best Practices

### Choosing a Broker

Consider:
- âœ… Regulation and safety
- âœ… Spreads and commissions
- âœ… Server location (latency)
- âœ… MT5 support quality
- âœ… VPS compatibility

### Multiple Brokers

Run multiple brokers simultaneously:

```bash
# Clone repo for each broker
git clone <repo> tradestation-xm
cd tradestation-xm
# Edit .env: BROKER=xm
make install

cd ..
git clone <repo> tradestation-ic
cd tradestation-ic
# Edit .env: BROKER=ic_markets
make install
```

Each deployment is isolated and independent.
