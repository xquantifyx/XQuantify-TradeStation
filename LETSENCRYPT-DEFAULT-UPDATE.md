chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh

# During installation:
Select SSL option (1-3) [default: 1]: 1

Enter your domain name: mt5.mycompany.com
Enter email for SSL notifications: admin@mycompany.com

# Installer does everything automatically:
# ✓ Checks DNS
# ✓ Requests certificate from Let's Encrypt
# ✓ Configures nginx
# ✓ Sets up auto-renewal

# Access (no browser warnings!):
https://mt5.mycompany.com:8443/vnc.html
```

### Fresh Install (Testing/Development)

```bash
chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh

# During installation:
Select SSL option (1-3) [default: 1]: 2

# Installer generates self-signed certificate automatically
# No domain required - uses server IP

# Access (browser warning expected):
https://107.150.25.53:8443/vnc.html
```

### Fresh Install (Quick Start - No Domain)

```bash
chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh

# During installation:
Select SSL option (1-3) [default: 1]: 1

Enter your domain name: [press Enter - no domain]

# Auto-fallback to self-signed certificate
# ✓ Works immediately with IP address
```

---

## 🔧 Migration Guide

### For Existing Users (Currently Using Self-Signed)

If you have XQuantify TradeStation already running with self-signed certificates:

**Option 1: Add Let's Encrypt to Current Installation**

```bash
cd ~/XQuantify-TradeStation

# Setup Let's Encrypt
./scripts/setup-letsencrypt.sh mt5.yourdomain.com

# Enter email when prompted
# Old self-signed certs backed up automatically

# Update bookmarks:
# Old: https://107.150.25.53:8443/vnc.html
# New: https://mt5.yourdomain.com:8443/vnc.html
```

**Option 2: Keep Self-Signed (No Changes Needed)**

Your current setup continues working exactly as before. The changes only affect **fresh installations**.

```bash
# Current access still works:
https://YOUR_SERVER_IP:8443/vnc.html

# Click browser warning and proceed (unchanged)
```

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Installation Logic Flow

```
Start Installation
    ↓
Choose Broker
    ↓
Configure VNC Password
    ↓
[SSL Configuration] ← UPDATED
    ↓
Option 1 (DEFAULT): Let's Encrypt
    ├→ Ask for domain name
    ├→ Ask for email
    ├→ Validate inputs
    ├→ If valid: Setup Let's Encrypt
    ├→ If invalid/empty: Fallback to self-signed
    └→ If Let's Encrypt fails: Auto-fallback to self-signed
    ↓
Option 2: Self-signed
    ├→ Generate certificate with server IP
    └→ No domain required
    ↓
Option 3: Skip SSL
    └→ HTTP only (not recommended)
    ↓
Build & Start Services
    ↓
Display Access URLs
    └→ Different URLs for Let's Encrypt vs self-signed
```

### Fallback Strategy

The installer is **intelligent and fault-tolerant**:

1. **User chooses Let's Encrypt but no domain?** → Auto-fallback to self-signed
2. **DNS not configured?** → Fallback to self-signed + instructions
3. **Port 80 conflict?** → Offer nginx coexistence or fallback
4. **Let's Encrypt fails?** → Auto-fallback to self-signed
5. **No internet connection?** → Generate self-signed locally

**Result:** Installation **never fails** - always produces working setup!
